Don't waste your time on this repo, this is very much useless to everyone but me and my family. This is the code and architecture that runs the House.

# TODOs
* Deploy managed systemd files
* Integrate rainfall data
* Protect MQTT
* Irrigation settings POST doesn't work
* Move state to a db
* For heating, force the fan speed if outdoor temperature is <[5~7]Â°C

# Pie in the sky
