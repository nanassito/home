# Home
Don't waste your time on this repo, this is very much useless to everyone but me and my family. This is the code and architecture that runs the House.

# TODOs
* Deploy managed systemd files
* Integrate rainfall data
* Protect MQTT
* Move state to a db
* For heating, force the fan speed if outdoor temperature is <[5~7]Â°C
* No need to water if `avg_over_time(mqtt_humidity{topic="zigbee2mqtt_air_outside"}[7d]) > 85`
* Maybe double the watering time if `avg_over_time(mqtt_humidity{topic="zigbee2mqtt_air_outside"}[7d]) < 25`

# Pie in the sky
* Integrate weather forecast?
